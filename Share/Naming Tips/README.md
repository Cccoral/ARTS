# Summary
## Aim
It easier to learn a system, resolves ambiguities, dissolves confusion, promotes insight

## Methods, Classes and Variables

  - Do not name methods "ProcessData()"
  <br>命名不要泛泛而谈
  <br>you need to have a special name 

  - Use naming to help you design the program
  <br>命名及注释组织程序结构
  <br>These are now your function names and the sentence is your program's structure

  - If it's general, it better be generalized
  <br>命名应根据类型需求收放自如

  - Avoid discussing hard work
  <br>避免过度命名

  - Avoid class names that end with "Manager"
  <br>类命名避免以"Manager"结尾
  <br>They make you think of basic algorithms as if they were complicated black-boxes.

  - Use singular names for enumerations
  <br>枚举类型通常用单数形式命名
  <br>除非枚举类型需要组合
  <br>An enumeration/Enum is a list of all possible values for a single entity. Call it animalType instead of animalTypes. 

  - Avoid superlatives
  <br>避免过多继承

  - Don't hide behind your names
  <br>不以代码中某一功能来命名 全局考虑

  - Don't forget to have a vowel movement
  <br>少用缩写
  "f u cn rd ths u cd b a cmptr prgrmmr" 

  - Consistency, Consistency, Consistency
  <br>文档与程序中术语命名应维持一致性

  - Don't be afraid to rename
  <br>重命名不可怕
  <br>只要不是以公开的Api发布

## Frameworks & Libraries
<br>他人用你代码二次开发，可以考虑命名空间用以区分

  - Prefer namespaces instead of "nsStupidClassPrefix"
  <br>命名空间比类前缀好
  - Extend a generic namespace, don't create MyCompanyName.Widgets
  <br>少以公司名命名命名空间

  ## Databases
  <br>...未整理...
  ## Things
  - Name physical things what they are, not what they're doing
  <br>真实事物以其本质命名
  - Name logical things after what they're doing, not what they are
  <br>逻辑事物以其实现命名
